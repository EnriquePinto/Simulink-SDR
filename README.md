# Simulink-SDR
Files from my Software Defined Radio final project. 

- All the files that are not powerpoint or pdf are Matlab r2015a Simulink files
- The project follows the framework of "Software Defined Radio using MATLAB & Simulink and the RTL-SDR" by Robert W. Stewart, Kenneth W. Barlee, Dale S. W. Atkinson, and Louise H. Crockett
- There are 3 separate files: 1 for the transmitter, other for the receiver, and other for a transmitter-channel-receiver model (used for designing and debugging)
- The project worked really well in practice, i.e. with the actual RTL-SDR (it was a actually surprised by how robust and stable communications were!)
- Everything is in portuguese, like in many of the other projects
